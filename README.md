# CLUSTERINNODE
Clustering is the launch of multiple instances of the same application to distribute processing of incoming requests between them. And this is one of the implementations of this approach.
## Installation

```bash
$ npm init
$ npm i colors
```
## Running the app

```bash
# run
$ node cluster.js

# SIGUSR2 exit code
$ kill -s SIGUSR2 *Your Procces Pid*

# SIGINT exit code
$ kill *Your Procces Pid*
```
