# CLUSTERINNODE
Clustering is the launch of multiple instances of the same application to distribute the processing of incoming requests between them. And this is my implementation of this approach.

## Running the app

```bash
# run
$ node cluster.js

# SIGUSR2 exit code
$ kill -s SIGUSR2 *Your Procces Pid*

# SIGINT exit code
$ kill *Your Procces Pid*
```
